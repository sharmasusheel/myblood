&nbsp;<strong>The tradition of celebration of the World Red Cross Day on May 8th, was this year observed by paying tribute to the volunteers for their unprecedented contribution to the people in need. A seminar was held at the National Headquarter on the theme, ‘Our strength, Our future- Committed Volunteer’ and in this seminar the experienced members of Indian Red Cross Society, commended the volunteers for their selfless efforts. Since the inception of Red Cross, voluntary action has been its quintessence. Volunteering, serves as a means in helping the society to bridge the gap between the crisis and the crisis management.

In the States of Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chandigarh and Kolkata, celebrations were made by honoring the Red Cross Volunteers. The volunteers were felicitated with complete gusto and their altruistic outlook towards the Society was acknowledged. Governors and Ministers of the respective states also attended the programmes and all this got a good coverage in the leading newspapers and television channels throughout the country. Message on the theme and radio talks were also relayed by many stations of All India Radio.</strong><br />
